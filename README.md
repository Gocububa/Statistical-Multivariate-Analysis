# Statistical-Multivariate-Analysis
This repository contains the code and documentation for a statistical multivariate analysis project. The analyses conducted in this project cover various techniques to explore and infer relationships in high-dimensional datasets. Below is an overview of the analyses and methods used.

The main objectives of this project were:

1-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed initial data exploration to understand the structure, patterns, and key characteristics of the dataset.

2-Inferences About a Mean Vector
Conducted hypothesis testing to draw conclusions about the population mean vector based on sample data.

3-Comparisons of Several Multivariate Means
Analyzed whether multiple groups significantly differ in their multivariate mean vectors using appropriate statistical tests.

4-Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Principal Components Regression
Reduced data dimensionality while retaining variance and developed regression models using principal components as predictors.

5-Factor Analysis and Factor Rotation
Identified underlying latent factors in the dataset and applied factor rotation techniques to improve interpretability.

6-Discrimination and Classification
Built classification models to assign observations to predefined groups and evaluated model performance.

7-Clustering
Applied unsupervised learning techniques to group similar observations without prior knowledge of group labels.

8-Canonical Correlation Analysis
Explored relationships between two sets of variables by finding linear combinations that maximize correlation.
